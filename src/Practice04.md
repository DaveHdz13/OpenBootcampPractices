# Practice for subject 4
On this practice we'll see how control statements work.

We use control statements such as:
 - If
 - While
 - Do While
 - For
 - Switch

> All of these statements are inside functions.

## If statement
Create a condition that checks if ***number*** is **negative, positive or zero**.

![ifStatement](/img/ifStatement.png)

And we call it.

![callingIf](/img/callingIf.png)

## While statement
On this statement we add 1 to ***number*** until it equals **3**.

While is going to check that ***number*** its not mayor than 3 and then does something.

Calling the function like this:

![callingWhile](/img/callingWhile.png)

## Do while statement
We use the same idea from **While** but this time we only print once.

The idea is to **do something before cheking if ***number*** has gotten to 3**.

And the call looks like this:

![callingDoWhile](/img/callingDoWhile.png)

## For statement
Creating a for statement takes 3 things:
 - Initialized variable
 - Checking variables
 - Adding or deacresing variables

We initialize ***number*** to 0, we check if ***number*** its less or equal than 3, and we add one each time ***number*** is like our second part of code.

Calling the function again:

![callingFor](/img/callingFor.png)

## Switch statement
In this statement we use a seasonal example.

If ***season*** is Winter or Spring, the switch statement is going to **determine and print** a sentence that confirms it.

Check the call:

Check the code:
 - [If Statement Code!](./Controls/ifStatements.java)
 - [While Statement Code!](./Controls/whileStatements.java)
 - [Do While Statement Code!](./Controls/dowhileStatements.java)
 - [For Statement Code!](./Controls/forStatements.java)
 - [Switch Statement Code!](./Controls/switchStatements.java)
